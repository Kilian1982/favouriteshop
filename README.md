The app is composed of four screens: 
The first is displays any shops in the list with the name, description and an image of the shop. 
In the on top of the first screen we have an actionbar which leads to the second and third screen.
The second screen is where we can add a new shop to the list.
Here you can add:   The name of the shop,
                    A short description,
                    Select the location,
                    And add an image of the shop.
Clicking on the shop leads to the next screen where you can edit the details of the shop and change the location of the shop.  



## Overview
The app does the following:

1. Display the list of shops with an images either sourced from the internet or taken by the user with the phone, shop name and short description.
2. Allows users to add shops to their list.
3. Allow user to edit their shop list.
4. Display a map with all shops displayed on screen starting at the last shop added to the list.
