The app is composed of four screens: 
The first displays any shops in the list with the name, description and an image of the shop. 
In the on top of the first screen we have an actionbar which leads to two more screens.
pressing on the plus bottun leads to the second screen.
The second screen is where we can add a new shop to the list.
Here you can add:   The name of the shop,
                    A short description,
                    Select the location,
                    And add an image of the shop.
The third Screen can be accessed by clicking on the button which looks like a map. 
On this screen the user will be shown a map of all the shops they have in their list. the user will also be able to access the details of the shop by clicking on the marker of each shop.
The last screen can be accessed by clicking on a shop in the list on the first screen. The user is led to the fourth screen where you can edit the details of the shop and change the location and image attched to the shop.
