## Favourite Shop App

**Designed by Kilian Kane** 
**Reference source: Course material Mobile app by Rob O’Connor, Siobhán Drohan and Eamonn De Leastar** 

The app is composed of four screens:<br> 
The first displays any shops in the list with the name, description and an image of the shop.<br>
In the on top of the first screen we have an action bar which leads to two more screens.<br>
Pressing on the plus button leads to the second screen.<br>
The second screen is where we can add a new shop to the list.<br>
Here you can add:   The name of the shop,
                    A short description,
                    Select the location,
                    And add an image of the shop.<br>
The third Screen can be accessed by clicking on the button which looks like a map.<br> 
On this screen the user will be shown a map of all the shops they have in their list.<br>
The user will also be able to access the details of the shop by clicking on the marker of each shop.<br>
The last screen can be accessed by clicking on a shop in the list on the first screen. The user is led to the fourth screen where you can edit the details of the shop and change the location and image attached to the shop. <br> 

## Overview
The app does the following:

1. Display the list of shops with an images either sourced from the internet or taken by the user with the phone, shop name and short description.
2. Allows users to add shops to their list.
3. Allow user to edit their shop list.
4. Display a map with all shops displayed on screen starting at the last shop added to the list.
5. When on the Map with all the shops a user can tap the marker and get the details of the shop.

## The Idea

When developing this app, I wanted to give the users the ability to be able to take note of shops they bought an item in. Then if they liked and wanted not to share what they bought but where they bought it, they were able to do so.<br>
Before when having conversations with friends, family or strangers, shopping would be a topic. You would talk about where you bought the item and then be asked where the shop is. With the app this would become easier to find and share the shop location and image of the shop. Sure, you could just open the maps app on your phone and slowly drill down to the shop location but that takes time.<br>
This was the inspiration for my App: A simple and quick way of showing your friends, family and others the shops you like and shops they may have an interest in.                

## Development and the future of the app.
During the develop of the app my main goal was to ensure that all the crud functionally was working, the look of the app was appealing at first to the ladies and as time goes on add the ability to change the colour for the gents.<br>
Other functions i wanted to add where, a search bar, a share button to social media of the user’s choice and add reviews of the shops with a rating system for the likes of customer service and choice. 

## Findings
I did try to add firebase to help store the data but found the documentation on the subject hard to read and incorporate into the App. The same can be said for both adding the search bar and the social media share button. I did find that changing the look of the app quite enjoyable.
