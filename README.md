## Overview
The app does the following:

1. Display the list of shops with an images either sourced from the internet or taken by the user with the phone, shop name and short description.
2. Allows users to add shops to their list.
3. Allow user to edit their shop list.
4. Display a map with all shops displayed on screen starting at the last shop added to the list.
5. When on the Map with all the shops a user can tap the marker and get the details of the shop.

## The Idea

When developing this app, I wanted to give the users the ability to be able to take note of shops they bought an item in. Then if they liked and wanted not to share what they bought but where they bought it, they were able to do so.<br>
Before when having conversations with friends, family or strangers, shopping would be a topic. You would talk about where you bought the item and then be asked where the shop is. With the app this would become easier to find and share the shop location and image of the shop. Sure, you could just open the maps app on your phone and slowly drill down to the shop location but that takes time.<br>
This was the inspiration for my App: A simple and quick way of showing your friends, family and others the shops you like and shops they may have an interest in.                

## Development and the future of the app.
During the develop of the app my main goal was to ensure that all the crud functionally was working, the look of the app was appealing at first to the ladies and as time goes on add the ability to change the colour for the gents.<br>
Other functions i wanted to add where, a search bar, a share button to social media of the user’s choice and add reviews of the shops with a rating system for the likes of customer service and choice. 

## Findings
I did try to add firebase to help store the data but found the documentation on the subject hard to read and incorporate into the App. The same can be said for both adding the search bar and the social media share button. I did find that changing the look of the app quite enjoyable and designing the app icon fun and user friendly.
